Pseudo Code test

#1, State Real Estate Agents Directories should be reworded.
I.e. Directories by state for Real Estate Agents

#2, When I look at the content being displayed, my eyes tend to go down the column
of the list instead of left to right. The alternating colors for each line help
but not that much

I would have the php loop through the list and display what was needed into a
html table with a class="list*" which can later be formated with css to display
next to each other.



<?php
echo "<table class=\"list1\">"
for( $i = 0; i < $list.size()/2; i++) {
  echo <tr>$list[i]</tr>
}
echo "<table class=\"list2\">"
for( $i = $list.size()/2; i < $list.size(); i++) {
  echo <tr>$list[i]</tr>
}
?>
